# My vim config files

Yeah, it's just that.

## Requirements
Probably vim 8+. Don't use neovim as pathogen won't work.

# Installation
Clone the repo as ~/.vim or whatever vim config path you have
Cd into it and run these two commands

``` sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
That's it! If you have any problems, feel free to make an issue.
